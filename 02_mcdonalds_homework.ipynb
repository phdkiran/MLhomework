    "New comments have been submitted to the McDonald's website, and you need to **score them with the likelihood** that they are referring to rude service.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before making predictions on out-of-sample data, it is important to re-train your model on all relevant data using the tuning parameters and preprocessing steps that produced the best AUC above.\n",
    "    - In other words, X should be defined using either **all rows** or **only those rows with a confidence_mean of at least 0.75**, whichever produced a better AUC above.\n",
    "    - X should refer to either the **review column** or the **review_city column**, whichever produced a better AUC above.\n",
    "    - CountVectorizer should be instantiated with the **tuning parameters** that produced the best AUC above.\n",
    "    - **`train_test_split()`** should not be used during this process.\n",
    "2. Build a document-term matrix (from X) called **X_dtm**, and examine its shape.\n",
    "3. Read the new comments stored in **`mcdonalds_new.csv`** into a DataFrame called **new_comments**, and examine it.\n",
    "4. If your model uses a **review_city** column, create that column in the new_comments DataFrame. (Otherwise, skip this step.)\n",
    "5. Build a document_term matrix (from the **new_comments** DataFrame) called **new_dtm**, and examine its shape.\n",
    "6. Train your best model (Naive Bayes or logistic regression) using **X_dtm** and **y**.\n",
    "7. Predict the \"rude probability\" for each comment in **new_dtm**, and store the probabilities in an object called **new_pred_prob**.\n",
    "8. Print the **full text** for each new comment alongside its **\"rude probability\"**. (You may need to [increase the max_colwidth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiO43TQ4xvc&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y&index=28) to see the full text.) Examine the results, and comment on how well you think the model performed!"

Don't even bother changing your mind oh NO! They will glare at you and snap at you if you want to change something.  I understand its FAST food, but I want my order placed right.  Not going back if I can help it. Portland   \n",

Even though it is still fast food, the service at the drive-thru is the best. They rarely make a mistake and I never see anyone parked in the drive-thru slots where they bring food out because they don't have it ready. So, if you like McDonald's fast food, it doesn't get any better than this.    \n",
